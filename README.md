# GuessMyNumber_Project1

Simple game of guessing a number between 1 and 20. 
If the guess is wrong, the score (starting from 20) will decrease by one, whereas if the guess is right, the highscore will be set to the score.
The game is over if the score is 0 and can be re-played by pressing the "Again!" button.

Project inspired by Udemy Course "The Complete JavaScript Course 2023: From Zero to Expert!" by Jonas Schmedtmann.
